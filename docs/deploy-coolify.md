# Deploying Ilot to Coolify (Hostinger VPS)

This is the exact runbook that matches the `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` +
`next.config.ts (output: 'standalone')` committed to this repo. Links below
point to the official Coolify docs that were used to design it.

> **Coolify concepts refresher.** A *Project* is the top-level folder,
> a *Resource* is an app / database / service, and an *Environment* (e.g.
> `production`) groups Resources inside a Project.

## 0. Prerequisites

- Coolify is already installed, TLS on `coolify.<your-domain>` works, and the
  `*.<your-domain>` wildcard DNS points to the VPS IP.
  (All of this is the Phase 0 work in `docs/next-steps.md`.)
- GitHub repository `Shahab-hsni/Ilot` is reachable either as a public repo
  or via Coolify's **GitHub App** / **Deploy Key** integration.
- A Sanity project exists and you have a read token
  (`SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`) — the dataset is **private**, so anonymous
  fetches will 401.

## 1. Commit the Docker setup

The files that just landed in the repo:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build: deps → build → runner. Emits the standalone Next.js server on port 3000 as user `nextjs`. |
| `.dockerignore` | Keeps `node_modules`, `.next`, `.env*`, `docs/`, `tests/`, `.claude/`, `.superpowers/` out of the build context. |
| `next.config.ts` | Adds `output: 'standalone'` — required for the Dockerfile to find `.next/standalone/server.js`. |

```bash
git add Dockerfile .dockerignore next.config.ts docs/deploy-coolify.md
git commit -m "chore(deploy): add Coolify Dockerfile + standalone output"
git push origin main
```

---

## 2. Coolify Application — General tab

You already started this. The screenshot showed `Build Pack = Dockerfile`,
which is correct. Verify the other fields:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `Ilot Legal Frontend` (spelling — yours had "Froontend") |
| **Build Pack** | `Dockerfile` |
| **Base Directory** | `/` |
| **Dockerfile Location** | `/Dockerfile` |
| **Docker Build Stage Target** | _(empty — the Dockerfile's last stage `runner` is the default)_ |
| **Custom Docker Options** | **LEAVE EMPTY**. The `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device=/dev/fuse …` text shown in the UI is **placeholder example text**, not a default. If you leave it there it will try to run the container with fuse devices and fail. |
| **Ports Exposes** | `3000` |
| **Port Mappings** | Leave empty unless you need host-port binding (Coolify's Traefik routes domain → container:3000 already) |
| **Pre/Post-deployment commands** | **LEAVE EMPTY**. `php artisan migrate` is a placeholder for Laravel apps. This project has no migrations to run. |

## 3. Environment Variables tab

Coolify injects every variable here **both** as a runtime env var *and* as
a Docker build `ARG` — meaning `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are baked into the
client bundle at build time, which is what Next.js requires.

| Key | Value | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://ilot.id` (or your real prod URL) | Public build-time |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WA_NUMBER` | `62812XXXXXXX` (no `+`, no spaces) | Public build-time |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` | from Sanity dashboard → API | Public build-time |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` | `production` | Public build-time |
| `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` | viewer token from Sanity → API → Tokens | Server-only runtime |
| `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` | _(only needed if you'll run `pnpm import:sanity` from a container — otherwise skip)_ | Server-only runtime |

**Don't** tick "Is Build Variable?" off on the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` ones — they
must be available during `next build`.

Docs: <https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/environment-variables>

## 4. Persistent Storage tab — the one thing easy to forget

Next.js 15's ISR cache lives in `.next/cache`. Without a volume, every
redeploy wipes the cache and the first hit on every page re-fetches from
Sanity → slow cold paths. Mount one volume:

1. Click **+ Add Volume**.
2. **Name:** `next-cache`
3. **Destination Path:** `/app/.next/cache`
4. Leave **Source Path** empty (Docker-managed volume — Coolify auto-appends
   the resource UUID so it's unique per app).

That's it. One volume, done.

Docs: <https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/persistent-storage>

> **Why `/app/.next/cache`?** The Coolify docs state verbatim: *"The base
> directory inside the container is `/app`."* The `WORKDIR` in our Dockerfile
> matches, and the `chown -R nextjs:nodejs .next` line in the runner stage
> ensures the mounted volume is writable by the non-root user.

---

## 5. Domains tab

Set the primary domain, e.g. `https://ilot.id`. Coolify's Traefik proxy
will request a Let's Encrypt cert automatically on the first request
(same flow as `n8n.ilot.example` in your existing `next-steps.md`).

If you want `www.ilot.id` to redirect to the apex, set
**Direction = "Allow www & non-www"** in the General tab → **Set Direction**.

---

## 6. Sanity CORS — 30-second step

Sanity's dashboard → **API → CORS Origins → Add Origin** → paste your new
production URL (e.g. `https://ilot.id`). Without this the in-page
`/studio` route will 401 on browsers outside Sanity's own origin list.

You don't need to touch CORS for server-side GROQ — those requests come
from your container, not the browser.

---

## 7. Deploy

Click the big **Deploy** button (top-right in the Coolify UI).

Watch **Deployments** tab → **Logs**. The first build is slow (~3–5 min)
because Alpine has to download Node and the deps layer. Subsequent builds
will reuse the `deps` layer unless `package-lock.json` changes.

**Expected final log lines:**
```
▲ Next.js 15.5.14
- Local:        http://0.0.0.0:3000
✓ Ready in …ms
```

Then visit either the generated `*.sslip.io` URL (Coolify auto-assigns one
— you already have it: `nuy3v2h400jw7272uhdo19cp.76.13.211.156.sslip.io`)
or your custom domain once TLS is ready.

---

## 8. Smoke tests to run after the first green deploy

1. `GET /` — homepage renders the scroll-linked hero on desktop.
2. `GET /visa` — a category page renders with the real Sanity data
   (proves `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` is correct).
3. `GET /visa/investor-kitas-2-years` — a service page renders with
   category color banner.
4. `GET /sitemap.xml` — returns a populated sitemap (proves ISR-at-build
   worked).
5. `GET /studio` — the Sanity Studio shell loads (proves the webpack shims
   for React 19 + Sanity are working in the built bundle).
6. WhatsApp floating button opens `wa.me/<NEXT_PUBLIC_WA_NUMBER>` with
   the correct number.

---

## 9. Turning off Vercel

Once everything above is green for 24 hours and DNS for `ilot.id` points
to the VPS (not Vercel's edge), delete the Vercel project so you don't
pay twice. Nothing in the codebase needs to change.

---

## Common failure modes & fixes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Container shows **Exited** / **Unhealthy** immediately after build | `Dockerfile` missing or standalone output not produced | Verify `output: 'standalone'` is in `next.config.ts` (it now is) and that this commit is pushed to the branch Coolify tracks |
| Build succeeds but pages are blank / show 401 data | `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` not set | Add it in Environment Variables → redeploy |
| Client-side JS throws `projectId is undefined` | A `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` var wasn't set at build time | Set it in Environment Variables → click **Deploy** again (not just **Restart**) |
| `/studio` crashes with "c is not a function" | React 19 / Sanity shims didn't run | Don't change `next.config.ts`'s webpack block — it's load-bearing |
| Cold ISR on every page after restart | `.next/cache` volume not mounted | Re-check Persistent Storage step |
| Deploy eats all VPS memory | 2 vCPU / 2 GB is the minimum that reliably builds Next.js 15 + Sanity Studio together | Upsize the droplet, or use Coolify's **Use a Build Server** feature on the General tab to offload the build |
| Container runs but "No Available Server" at the domain | Port mismatch | `Ports Exposes` must be `3000` (matches the Dockerfile `EXPOSE 3000` + `PORT=3000`) |
